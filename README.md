Taking a walk through the guide.  Just getting started!
I have played "good mom" by encouraging my daughters to go into science and learn how to code along the way.  
They countered, "If learning how to code is so important, why aren't you learning to code?"
I decided it was both a good argument and a great question, so here I am, Really Old, and Learning to Code!
